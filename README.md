# liigadb
Django-based database for Liiga ice hockey data read with liigadata parser

This project is mainly for my own use, the database for handling Finnish Liiga hockey data
and utilities for reading the data files created by my liigadata-project: https://github.com/hmm/liigadata

Because this is for my own use, there is next to zero documentation or comments. Contact me for help if you have questions.

The twitter account @smliigadata data is processed using this code
