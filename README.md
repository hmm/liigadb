# liigadb
Django-based database for Liiga ice hockey data read with liigadata parser

This project is mainly for my own use, the database for handling Finnish Liiga hockey data
and utilities for reading the data files created by the liigadata-project

Because this is for my own use, there is next to zero documentation or comments. If you are interested, email me.

The twitter account @smliigadata data is processed using this code
